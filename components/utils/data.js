Using digital segmentation techniques, the dentition and neurovasculature were reconstructed from the dentary CT data, while the internal cavities that would have housed the endosseous labyrinth, cranial nerves and floccular lobe were reconstructed from the braincase CT data. The relationships between functional, replacement and non-functional old teeth at each tooth row was examined to investigate the different stages of tooth replacement in this new ornithopod.",
